# employee-tracker-CMS
A CMS application to help a company keep track of employees by being able to add them, delete them, and udpate employee data. This particular app is useful for a carnival or amusement park setting.

## Technology

Javascript, Node.js, express, mySQL, and markdown(.md) 
## Installation

To install this code, clone the files from the repository https://github.com/kddayhoff/employee-tracker-CMS and open in your preferred code editor
​
## Usage 
​
On the terminal/gitbash, enter node server.js. From there the user will be prompted to choose if they want to add an employee, update an employee, delete an employee or exit the application. Should they choose to add an employee, the user will be presented with questions about the employee's information. These answers will be added to our mySQL database. To update an employee, the user will choose the current employee ID, and the user can then update the employee's info. To delete an employee, the user just has to choose an employee ID and then the employee will be deleted from the datas.

Feel free to make this better. It's like Thoreau's <i>Walden</i>, nothing is original. Take an axe for example, you're not going to reinvent the axe. However, you can always leave it sharper than when you found it.
